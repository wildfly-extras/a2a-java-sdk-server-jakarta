# A2A Java SDK for Jakarta Servers

This is the integration of the [A2A Java SDK](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-java) for use in Jakarta servers. It is currently tested on **WildFly**, but it should be usable in other compliant Jakarta servers such as Tomcat, Jetty, and OpenLiberty. For Quarkus, use the reference implementation in the [A2A Java SDK](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-java) project.

For more information about the A2A protocol, see [here](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-spec).

## Getting Started

To use the A2A Java SDK in your application, you will need to package it as a `.war` file. This can be done with your standard build tool.

### Packaging your application

The key to enabling A2A in your Java application is to correctly package it. Here are the general steps you need to follow:

1.  **Create a standard `.war` archive:** Your project should be configured to produce a `.war` file. This is a standard format for web applications in Java and is supported by all major runtimes.

2.  **Provide implementations for `AgentExecutor` and `AgentCard`:** The A2A SDK requires you to provide your own implementations of the `AgentExecutor` and `AgentCard` interfaces. These are the core components that define the behavior of your agent. You can find more information about them in the [A2A Java SDK documentation](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-java).

3.  **Manage Dependencies:** Your `.war` file must contain all necessary libraries in the `/WEB-INF/lib` directory. However, some libraries may already be provided by the application server itself.

    * **Bundling Dependencies:** For libraries not provided by the server, you must bundle them inside your `.war`.

    * **Provided Dependencies:** To avoid conflicts and reduce the size of your archive, you should exclude libraries that your target runtime already provides. For example, **WildFly** includes the **Jackson** libraries, so you do not need to package them in your application. Check the documentation for your specific runtime (Tomcat, Jetty, OpenLiberty, etc.) to see which dependencies are provided.

### Example

The [tck/pom.xml](./tck/pom.xml) is a good example of how to package an A2A application. Your application can support JSON-RPC, gRPC, or both. In this case, the application is deployed in WildFly, so the dependencies included in the `.war` are tailored to what WildFly provides.

In the `tck/pom.xml` we enable both JSON-RPC and gRPC, and have the following dependencies:

* `org.wildfly.a2a:a2a-java-sdk-jakarta-jsonrpc` - this is the dependency for **JSON-RPC** support. It transitively pulls in all the dependencies from the A2A Java SDK project.
    * Since some of these dependencies are provided by WildFly already, we exclude those so they do not become part of the `.war`, in order to avoid inconsistencies. If you only want to support gRPC, you can omit this dependency.
* `org.wildfly.a2a:a2a-java-sdk-server-jakarta-grpc` - this is the dependency for **gRPC** support.
    * We exclude the gRPC core libraries (`io.grpc` and `com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java`). This is because when deploying to WildFly with gRPC support, the server is provisioned with the WildFly gRPC feature-pack, which already provides these libraries. Including them in the `.war` would lead to conflicts. If you only want to support JSON-RPC, you can omit this dependency.
* `jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api` - this is not part of the dependencies brought in via the A2A dependencies but is needed to compile the TCK module. Since it is provided by WildFly, we make the scope `provided` so it is not included in the `.war`.
* `io.github.a2asdk:a2a-tck-server` - this is the application, which contains the `AgentExecutor` and `AgentCard` implementations for the TCK. In your case, they will most likely be implemented in the project you use to create the `.war`.
    * In this case we exclude all transitive dependencies, since we are doing the main dependency management via the `org.wildfly.a2a:a2a-java-sdk-jakarta-jsonrpc` and `org.wildfly.a2a:a2a-java-sdk-server-jakarta-grpc` dependencies.

If you are deploying to WildFly and want to use gRPC, you will also need to provision the server with the gRPC feature pack. You can see how this is done in the `wildfly-maven-plugin` configuration in the `tck/pom.xml`. Since the gRPC subsystem and feature pack are currently at the `preview` stability level, you will need to start the server with the `--stability=preview` argument.

There are also some [examples](./examples/README.md) that show how to package an application selecting each transport. 

## Running the TCK

The project includes a TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit) that you can use to test the integration with WildFly. 

To run the TCK, build the full project
```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

You now have a server provisioned with the `.war` deployed in the `tck/target/wildfly` folder.

We can start the server using the following command:

```bash
SUT_JSONRPC_URL=http://localhost:8080 SUT_GRPC_URL=http://localhost:9555 tck/target/wildfly/bin/standalone.sh --stability=preview
```

`--stability=preview` is needed since the TCK server is provisioned with the gRPC subsystem, which is currently at the `preview` stability level.

The `SUT_JSONRPC_URL` and `SUT_GRPC_URL` are used by the TCK server's `AgentCardProducer` to specify the transports supported by the server agent.

Once the server is up and running, run the TCK with the instructions in [a2aproject/a2a-tck](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-tck). Make sure you check out the correct tag of `a2aproject/a2a-tck` for the protocol version we are targeting.

Be sure to set `TCK_STREAMING_TIMEOUT=4.0` when running the TCK to ensure the tests wait long enough to receive the events for streaming methods.
